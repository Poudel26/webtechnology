        Thomas Watson was born on <strong>February 17, 1874</strong> into a family of Scottish decent who had emigrated from Ireland to avoid the potato famine. They were involved in the lumber business and the young Watson must have been influenced by the idea of commerce from an early age. When he finished school his father had ambitions of him becoming a lawyer but he had other ideas - he would be a teacher. A single day of teaching cured him of this plan!t
        So the next idea was to go into business. His father agreed as long as he went to business school. He completed the courses in accounting and business and immediately landed himself a job at $6 a week keeping the books of a butchers shop. But he didn't see sitting on a high stool with a pen keeping books as his lifetime's career. His next move was the one that probably set the course of the rest of his life. He went on the road selling sewing machines and pianos with a travelling salesman.
        He studied the sales techniques but he was not good at selling. He watched the more experience salesmen's techniques while holding the horses and learned. Eventually he got so good at it that when he quit the boss offered to sell him the business.</p>
